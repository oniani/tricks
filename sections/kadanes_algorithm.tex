\section{Kadane's Algorithm - Maximum Contiguous Subarray}

\begin{figure}[H]
    Optimal Solution:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
        Time Complexity:& \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the length of the array.\\
        Space Complexity:& \(O(1)\)
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

An implemmentation of the Kadane's algorithm.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{minted}{python}
        def max_subarray_sum(arr: list[float]) -> float:
            """Return the maximum subarray sum."""

            cur: float = 0
            res: float = float("-inf")
            for num in nums:
                cur = max(cur + num, num)
                res = max(res, cur)
            return res
    \end{minted}
\end{figure}

This algorithm is a trivial example of dynamic programming.
