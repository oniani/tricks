\subsection{Balanced Parentheses}

\begin{figure}[H]
    Optimal Solution:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
        Time Complexity:& \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the length of the string.\\
        Space Complexity:& \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number parentheses
        symbols.
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

The parentheses in a string are balanced if and only if the following two
conditions are met:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The number of \mintinline{python}{"("} and \mintinline{python}{")"}
          are equal
    \item Scanning through the string from left to right and counting how many
          \mintinline{python}{"("} and \mintinline{python}{")"} there are so
          far, there should never be a time where there are more
          \mintinline{python}{")"} than \mintinline{python}{"("}. We denote the
          balance of the string as
          \mintinline{python}{balance = count("(") - count(")")}
\end{enumerate}

If we only allow for \mintinline{python}{"()"} pair of parentheses, then the
following will check if the parenthesis are balanced:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{minted}{python}
        def is_balanced(string: str) -> bool:
            """Check if a given string has balanced parentheses."""

            balance: int = 0
            for char in string:
                if char == "(":
                    balance += 1
                elif char == ")":
                    balance -= 1

                if balance < 0:
                    return False

            return balance == 0
    \end{minted}
\end{figure}

If we allow for more than one pair of parentheses, the following stack-based
implementation generalizes well:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{minted}{python}
        def is_balanced(string: str) -> bool:
            """Check if a given string has balanced parentheses."""

            stack: list[str] = []
            closing: dict[str, str] = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
            opening: set[str] = set(closing.values())
            for char in string:
                if char in opening:
                    stack.append(char)
                elif char in closing:
                    if not stack or closing[char] != stack.pop():
                        return False

            return not stack
    \end{minted}
\end{figure}
