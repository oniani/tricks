\subsection{Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm -- Majority Element}

\begin{figure}[H]
    Optimal Solution:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
        Time Complexity:& \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the length of the array.\\
        Space Complexity:& \(O(1)\).
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Given an array of integers, find the majority element in the array.
The majority element is the element that appears more than
\(floor(\frac{n}{2})\) times. Assume that the majority element exists
in the array.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{minted}{python}
    def majority_element(nums: list[int]) -> int:
        """Find the majority element in the array."""

        candidate: int = 0
        count: int = 0
        for num in nums:
            # Candidate gets changed iff `count == 0`
            candidate = candidate if count else num
            # Increment/decrement based on whether candidate equals current
            count += 1 if candidate == num else -1

        return candidate
    \end{minted}
