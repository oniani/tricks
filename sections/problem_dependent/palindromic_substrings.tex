\subsection{Palindromic Substrings - Expand Around Center}

\begin{figure}[H]
    Optimal Solution:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
        Time Complexity:& \(O(m^2)\) where \(m\) is the length of the string.\\
        Space Complexity:& \(O(1)\).
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Count the number of palindromic substrings in this given string.
