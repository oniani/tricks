\subsection{Largest Area Square}

\begin{figure}[H]
    Optimal Solution:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
        Time Complexity:& \(O(m \times n)\) where \(m\) is the number of rows
        and \(n\) is the number of columns.\\
        Space Complexity:& \(O(m \times n)\) where \(m\) is the number of rows
        and \(n\) is the number of columns.
    \end{tabular}

Given an \(m \times n\) binary matrix of \(0\)s and \(1\)s, find the area
of the largest square containing only \(1\)s.

    \begin{minted}{python}
    def largest_area(self, matrix: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        """Return the area of the largest area square containing only 1s."""

        m: int = len(matrix)
        n: int = len(matrix[0])

        dp: list[list[int]] = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

        res: int = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1])
                    res = max(res, dp[i][j])

        return res ** 2
