\subsection{Rotate Array}

\begin{figure}[H]
    Optimal Solution:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
        Time Complexity:& \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the length of the array.\\
        Space Complexity:& \(O(1)\).
    \end{tabular}

Rotate array a given number of times. In other words, every element of the
array will be shifted to the right the given number of times.
