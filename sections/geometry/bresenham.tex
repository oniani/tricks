\subsection{Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm}

\begin{figure}[H]
    Optimal Solution:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
        Time Complexity:& \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the radius of the circle.\\
        Space Complexity:& \(O(1)\).
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Given a function that can draw a dot on the screen, write a function that draws
the circle with the given radius.

            x: int = 0

            # Initial y coordinate
            y: int = radius

            # Decision parameter
            d: int = 3 - 2 * radius
