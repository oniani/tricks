    Optimal Solution:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
        Time Complexity:& \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the number of iterations.\\
        Space Complexity:& \(O(1)\).

Given a function that can draw a dot on the screen, write a function that draws
the circle with the given radius.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{minted}{python}
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        def draw_circle(radius: float, step: float) -> None:
            """Draw a circle with a given radius."""

            angle: float = 0.0
            while angle <= 360:
                angle += step
                a: float = np.deg2rad(angle)
                x: float = radius * np.cos(a)
                y: float = radius * np.sin(a)
                plt.plot(x, y, marker=".")

            plt.title("Trigonometry-based Circle Drawing Algorithm")
            plt.show()
