\subsection{Dutch National Flag Problem}

\begin{figure}[H]
    Optimal Solution:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{rl}
        Time Complexity:& \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the length of the array.\\
        Space Complexity:& \(O(1)\).
    \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them
in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the
order red, white, and blue. Integers \(0\), \(1\), and \(2\) are used to
represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

            counts: Counter[int] = Counter(arr)

            # Index

            # Store all the 0s in the beginning 
            while (counts[0] > 0):

                counts[0] -= 1
                idx += 1

                arr[idx] = 1
                counts[1] -= 1
                idx += 1

            # Finally, all the 2s 
            while (counts[2] > 0): 
                arr[idx] = 2
